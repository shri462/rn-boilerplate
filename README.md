### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Running the App

```

## Configuration

### Key Configuration Files

- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration
- `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint rules
- `.prettierrc.js` - Prettier formatting rules

## Authentication

The app uses JWT-based authentication with secure storage using `react-native-keychain`. The authentication flow includes:

- Login
- OTP verification
- Token management
- Secure storage of credentials

## Navigation

The app uses React Navigation with the following navigation types:

- Stack Navigation (`@react-navigation/native-stack`)
- Bottom Tab Navigation (`@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`)
- Material Top Tabs (`@react-navigation/material-top-tabs`)

## API Integration

The app uses `@tanstack/react-query` for API integration with the following features:

- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Optimistic updates

## Error Handling

The app implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- Global error boundary
- API error handling
- Form validation using `yup` and `react-hook-form`
- Toast messages for user feedback
- Network error handling using `@react-native-community/netinfo`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the naming conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LoginScreen.tsx`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IUserData`)

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use local state (useState) for component-specific state

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status

# Create and switch to a new branch (follow naming convention)
git checkout -b your-name/main/your-feature-name
# Example: git checkout -b john/main/add-login-screen

# Pull latest changes from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Stage your changes
git add .                    # Stage all changes

# Commit your changes (using commitizen)
yarn cm

# Push your changes
git push origin your-name/main/your-feature-name
```

Note: Always create feature branches from the `main` branch and follow the naming convention: `your-name/main/your-feature-name`

### Code Review Process

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Get code review
5. Address review comments
6. Merge after approval

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### iOS

1. Pod Install Issues

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod cache clean --all
pod install
```

2. Build Issues

- Clean the build folder in Xcode
- Delete derived data
- Reset iOS simulator

#### Android

1. Build Issues

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

2. Keystore Issues

- Verify keystore file location
- Check gradle.properties configuration
- Ensure correct keystore password

### Environment Setup Issues

1. Node.js Version Issues

   - Use nvm to manage Node.js versions
   - Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version

2. Yarn Issues

   - Clear yarn cache: `yarn cache clean`
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall

3. Metro Bundler Issues
   - Clear metro cache: `yarn start --reset-cache`
   - Check metro.config.js for correct configuration
